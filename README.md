### Configuration
Some tips to set up your telegram bot.
- server should point to your moonraker host (like "192.168.1.50") You would better set it to your raspberry/orange host IP for default setup with Kiauh.
- bot_token - token for your bot. To create a new bot in telegram, talk to <a href="https://telegram.me/BotFather">BotFather</a>
- chat_id - id for your chat with bot. To get this id, after creating a new bot write something to this bot, then navigate to https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_token>/getUpdates
  you will see json with information about your message, sent to the bot. Find chat_id there.
```
server = "localhost"
  # Using localhost is enough in most cases (also for default setup with Kiauh)
  # some sbc could have problems with connection to board ip addres due to power safe mode enabled on wifi
chat_id = ""
  # id for your chat with bot. To get this id, after creating a new bot write something to this bot,
  # then navigate to https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_token>/getUpdates
  # you will see json with information about your message, sent to the bot. Find chat_id there.
  # else this param could be taken using bot command /chat
bot_token = "1626698191:AAGmK3awq0R-LK5jqWmBKjcZssVNpqc1HGc"
  # token for your bot. To create a new bot in telegram, talk to <a href="https://telegram.me/BotFather">BotFather</a>
poweroff_device = "printer"
  # name of power device, configured in moonraker.

notify {
    # setting parameters to 0  will disable the corresponding notifications 
    percent = 5
    heigth = 5
}

timelapse {
    enabled = true
      # default is false
    heigth = 0.2
      # it will take photos if height change is equal provided in param
      # one may add gcode "RESPOND PREFIX=timelapse MSG=photo" in layer change g-code slicer
      # to enable photos on layer change regardless of layer height
    basedir = '/tmp/timelapse'
      # base drectory, were timelapse photos and videos are stored ( now it is automaticly cleaning) 
}

camera {
    host = 'http://{host}:8080/?action=stream'
        # camera streaming url. default is mjpeg url format on host address.
    flipVertically = false
